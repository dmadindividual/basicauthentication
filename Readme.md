# Rust HTTP Client Example

This Rust project demonstrates how to use the `reqwest` crate to make an HTTP GET request with basic authentication. The example sends a request to `http://httpbin.org/get` and prints the response.

## Requirements

- Rust (latest stable version is recommended)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-http-client-example.git
   cd rust-http-client-example
   ```

2. **Add dependencies**:

   Ensure your `Cargo.toml` includes the `reqwest` dependency. If not, add it:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   reqwest = "0.11"
   ```

## Usage

1. **Create the Rust source file**:

   Ensure you have the main Rust file with the following content:

   ```rust
   use reqwest::blocking::Client;
   use reqwest::Error;

   fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
       let client = Client::new();

       let user = "Ayomide".to_string();
       let passwd: Option<String> = None;

       let response = client.get("http://httpbin.org/get")
           .basic_auth(user, passwd)
           .send();

       println!("{:?}", response);

       Ok(())
   }
   ```

2. **Run the application**:

   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

   This will compile and execute the program, sending a GET request to `http://httpbin.org/get` with basic authentication using the username "Ayomide" and no password. The response will be printed to the console.

## Explanation

- `use reqwest::blocking::Client;`: Imports the blocking `Client` from the `reqwest` crate.
- `use reqwest::Error;`: Imports the `Error` type from the `reqwest` crate.
- `let client = Client::new();`: Creates a new `Client` instance.
- `let user = "Ayomide".to_string();`: Sets the username for basic authentication.
- `let passwd: Option<String> = None;`: Sets the password for basic authentication to `None`.
- `let response = client.get("http://httpbin.org/get").basic_auth(user, passwd).send();`: Sends a GET request to `http://httpbin.org/get` with basic authentication.
- `println!("{:?}", response);`: Prints the response to the console.
- `Ok(())`: Returns `Ok(())` indicating the program executed successfully.
